# Dataset and ML Model for prediction of spectral characteristics of red and near-infrared emitting carbon dots

[![DOI]](https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202310402)

This repository contents the dataset of synthetic parameters and optical properties of carbon dots with optical transitions in the red and near-infrared spectral ranges. A model for prediction of spectral characteristics of these carbon dots based on multiple linear regression.


The dataset and the model are used in the following article:
